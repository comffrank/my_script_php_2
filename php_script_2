> Constants and (global) variables are in a different namespace. This implies that for example true and $TRUE are generally different. 

This means that you may assign a value to a variable with the same name of a constant, which might lead to unwanted results.

<?php
const FOO = "hello";
$FOO = "goodbye";
echo $FOO;
?>

will output ``goodbye''.
